# The Project
The Goal of this project is to create a Tezo smart contract and deploy onto the
Tezos testnet. As the project further develops I will be adding additional
features.

## How to setup a new VagrantBox fast
Vagrant uses a feature called provisioning this allows you setup a new
environment with your own environment variables as well as all the CLI
equipment you will need.

## Provisioning 
Refer to Vagrants [documentation](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning)
if you get lost.
