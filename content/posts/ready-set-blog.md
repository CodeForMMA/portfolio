excerpt: A How to on How to Blog

I should fix the previews on these, because it sucks. Added this to my todoist. 

## The Blog
I spent a good while tuning this blog, not to mention the countless hours for the main
site. Learning the Gatsby framework was a uphill battle. Yet for someone who
hasn't touched the web development scene in almost a year I was quite impressed
at the amount of React and general Gatsby framework shenganigans I could
remember. 

## Whats next?
I will be editing this post till im at the point where its seemingly intautive
to just pop open vim tab and write to my hearts content. So expect to
see a lot of changes with the format of this post and the general theme of the
blog.

## What's really next?
Honestly, ill probably revisit this in a few weeks. Looking to do more Python
and C programming. Get my head round some new concepts.

*Dont worry about these, they're just samples*

```python
print("This line will be printed.")

x = 1
if x == 1:
    # indented four spaces
    print("x is 1.")

print("Goodbye, World!")

```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   // printf() displays the string inside quotation
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}

```
